## ✍️ Status

The project is currently in the Proof of Concept (POC) stage. I'm thrilled to announce my intention to open-source the tool along with a comprehensive setup guide, provided there is sufficient interest from the community. Your support in the form of **200** GitHub stars 🌟 is crucial to kickstart this project.
